\\ this is the game that I want to make without any external help or as a white hat project //

this game's name is Maze Escape

Goal/Rules of the game:
there is a hunter, and there is a victim.
the cop has to try to get the victum.
the victum has to try to get a ruby in the center of the maze.

if the hunter succeeds, he gets a point.
if the victim succeeds, he gets a point.

there are a total of 20 levels or so
whoever has the most points at the end wins the game

in the event of a tie, the two players must go into a match, without maze walls and try to tag eachother out.
there will be a period of 20 seconds where one player is the hunter and one is the victim after 20 seconds, the two switch roles.
this will go on untill one player is caught making him/her the ultimate champion of Maze Escape
